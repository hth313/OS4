OS4 is a banked page 4K module that must be plugged into port 4.
How this is done depends on your hardware or emulator.


Programming
===========

To make it easier to develop modules using OS4 the ``OS4.h`` header
file exists. This is provided in the source distribution along with
the fill source code. It is also available in NutStudio tools, making
it possible to just using a single include to get access to the entry
points and definitions suitable for the developer. Simply:

.. code-block:: ca65

   #include "OS4.h"

and you are good to go.
